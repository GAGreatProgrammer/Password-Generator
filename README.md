A password generator is a program that generates a random password of a given length with the parameters you need. The strength of a password depends not only on the length, but also on the characters included in it. The more complex the password, the harder it is to crack. A password consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is harder to guess. This improves the security of a system that uses such a password.

The password generator allows you to create a password of any length. Using the slider, you can generate a password that is 100 characters long. Also, you can create a list of passwords and save it in a text file. For ease of use, the program has a dark theme.
